            <p>
                Hello there! My name is Doris Sayos and I recently graduated at
                The Bernard M. Baruch College with a Bachelor of Business Administration.
                My main focus was Data Analytics.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy taking pictures of beautiful sceneries during my free time
                as well as skateboarding. I am a foodie and I love trying new food spots.
                I also have a cat named Fuzzy whom I adore very much.
            </p>
